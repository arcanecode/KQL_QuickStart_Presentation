# Kusto Query Language QuickStart

## Synopsis

SQL isn't the only query language in town, it's time to learn about KQL - The Kusto Query Language!

The Kusto Query Language, or KQL for short, is designed for querying very, very large datasets on the Azure platform. It can be used to query the data from many of the Azure monitoring tools, as well as the data your company has stored within Azure data clusters.

In this Kusto overview, you'll learn about the people who should be using KQL. Then you'll get a tour of the environments Kusto can be used in, and finally you'll see how to author a few basic Kusto queries.

Come join us for a fast-paced introduction to KQL - the Kusto Query Language!
